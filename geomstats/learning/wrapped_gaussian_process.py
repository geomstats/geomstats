    r"""Wrapped Gaussian Process.

    The implementation is based on the algorithm 4 of [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    space : Manifold
        Manifold.
    metric : RiemannianMetric
        Riemannian metric.
    prior : function
        Associate to each input a manifold valued point.
     kernel : kernel instance, default=None
        The kernel specifying the covariance function of the GP. If None is
        passed, the kernel ``ConstantKernel(1.0, constant_value_bounds="fixed")
        * RBF(1.0, length_scale_bounds="fixed")`` is used as default. Note that
        the kernel hyperparameters are optimized during fitting unless the
        bounds are marked as "fixed".
    alpha : float or ndarray of shape (n_samples,), default=1e-10
        Value added to the diagonal of the kernel matrix during fitting.
        This can prevent a potential numerical issue during fitting, by
        ensuring that the calculated values form a positive definite matrix.
        It can also be interpreted as the variance of additional Gaussian
        measurement noise on the training observations. Note that this is
        different from using a `WhiteKernel`. If an array is passed, it must
        have the same number of entries as the data used for fitting and is
        used as datapoint-dependent noise level. Allowing to specify the
        noise level directly as a parameter is mainly for convenience and
        for consistency with :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.Ridge`.
    optimizer : "fmin_l_bfgs_b" or callable, default="fmin_l_bfgs_b"
        Can either be one of the internally supported optimizers for optimizing
        the kernel's parameters, specified by a string, or an externally
        defined optimizer passed as a callable. If a callable is passed, it
        must have the signature::
            def optimizer(obj_func, initial_theta, bounds):
                # * 'obj_func': the objective function to be minimized, which
                #   takes the hyperparameters theta as a parameter and an
                #   optional flag eval_gradient, which determines if the
                #   gradient is returned additionally to the function value
                # * 'initial_theta': the initial value for theta, which can be
                #   used by local optimizers
                # * 'bounds': the bounds on the values of theta
                ....
                # Returned are the best found hyperparameters theta and
                # the corresponding value of the target function.
                return theta_opt, func_min
        Per default, the L-BFGS-B algorithm from `scipy.optimize.minimize`
        is used. If None is passed, the kernel's parameters are kept fixed.
        Available internal optimizers are: `{'fmin_l_bfgs_b'}`.
    n_restarts_optimizer : int, default=0
        The number of restarts of the optimizer for finding the kernel's
        parameters which maximize the log-marginal likelihood. The first run
        of the optimizer is performed from the kernel's initial parameters,
        the remaining ones (if any) from thetas sampled log-uniform randomly
        from the space of allowed theta-values. If greater than 0, all bounds
        must be finite. Note that `n_restarts_optimizer == 0` implies that one
        run is performed.
    copy_X_train : bool, default=True
        If True, a persistent copy of the training data is stored in the
        object. Otherwise, just a reference to the training data is stored,
        which might cause predictions to change if the data is modified
        externally.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation used to initialize the centers.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
