r"""Classes for the Wald Space and elements therein of class Wald and helper classes.

Class ``Structure``.
A structure is a partition into non-empty sets of the set :math:`\{0,\dots,n-1\}`,
together with a set of splits for each element of the partition, where every split is a
two-set partition of the respective element.
A structure basically describes a phylogenetic forest, where each set of splits gives
the structure of the tree with the labels of the corresponding element of the partition.

Class ``Wald``.
A wald is essentially a phylogenetic forest with weights between zero and one on the
edges. The forest structure is stored as a ``Structure`` and the edge weights are an
array of length that is equal to the total number of splits in the structure. These
elements are the points in Wald space and other phylogenetic forest spaces, like BHV
space, although the partition is just the whole set of labels in this case.

Class ``WaldSpace``.
A topological space. Points in Wald space are instances of the class :class:`Wald`:
phylogenetic forests with edge weights between 0 and 1.
In particular, Wald space is a stratified space, each stratum is called grove.
The highest dimensional groves correspond to fully resolved or binary trees.
The topology is obtained from embedding wälder into the ambient space of strictly
positive :math:`n\times n` symmetric matrices, implemented in the
class :class:`spd.SPDMatrices`.
