improvements for Testing Diff Geometry (iteration 2.0)
-----------------------------
* readiblity of doc strings in parametrizer
* Fiber Bundle parametrizer (I think pretty much every test in CorrelationMatricesBundle is generic)
* currently parametrizer are generating random data and testing, But we should also provide smoke data. Why?
  because if some knows the manifold well, they know the edge cases. we want to them to run for every iteration.

* need to make generic inverse checker in friendly way. There are many pair of functions whose composition
   we want to check, ones exp-log are being taken care of. Buttt
  -  extrinsic_to_angle and angle_to_extrinsic are inverses
  -  spherical_to_extrinsic and extrinsic_to_spherical are inverse

  essentially idea is to contruct a meta test_f1-f2-composition.

* random_point belongs is just testing random point. But let's say we want to other distributions
* add parametrizer tests that checks shapes for following things
     -  squared_dist_shape,
     -  square_norm_shape,
     -  dist_shape, norm_shape,
     -  inner_product_shape
     -  metric_pairwise shape
     -  christoffel shape
* add parametrizer test that  d(point_a, point_b) = ||Log(point_a, point_b)|| to connection or metric?
* add parametrizer test that squared_d(point_a, point_b) = ||Log(point_a, point_b)||^2
* add parametrizer test that d(point_a, point_a) = 0
* add parametrizer tests that dist_pairwise belongs to symmetric matrix
* add 'id' to pytest markers so tests can be marked with meaningful ids  id="edge case"




questions for Ninaa.
-------------------
* what is difference between spherical, intrinsic, extrinsic coords
