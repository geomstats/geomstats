# ModulationEmpiricalFrechetMean


Impact of the curvature on the empirical Fréchet mean estimation manifolds.
Experiments illustrating the modulation of the speed of convergence of the
empirical Fréchet mean with the curvature in spheres and hyperbolic spaces
described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07418).
