    "Key take-aways from this notebook:\n",
    "1. The connection tells us how much one vector in $T_pM$ changes when you move it infinitesimally in the direction of another vector in $T_pM$.\n",
    "2. The connection defines what it means for a vector to change, so it also allows us to define what it means for a vector to $\\textbf{not}$ change. This allows us to define the notion of parallel vector fields and parallel transport.\n",
    "3. A parallel vector field $X$ along a curve $\\gamma$ satisfies $$\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}(t)} X(t)=0$$ which means that each point along $\\gamma$, the vector $x \\in X$ will not change if it is moved infinitesimally in the direction of the curve's tangent vector $\\dot{\\gamma(t)}$.\n",
    "4. The parallel transport tells you what a vector would look like if you transported it non-infinitesimally along a curve.\n",
    "5. Equipping a manifold with a Riemannian metric is the only way to define a notion of ''distance\", ''length\" or any other sort of measurement on manifolds."
