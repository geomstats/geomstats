    "40% of São Paulo residents own a motor vehicle. While this is lower than cities in the United States, it is still higher than most other Latin American cities and São Paulo’s infrastructure was not built to accommodate such a large number of private vehicles. As The Urban Mobility Research Network of São Paulo found, some São Paulo residents spend one month per year in traffic, or 2.4 hours per day. As car ownership increases, and with it further congestion, this time spent in traffic will only grow. In that regard, considering the increase in car ownership and air pollution, even though widening roads only brings a temporary solution, it can alleviate Brazilians of the absurd amount of time they spend in traffic.\n",

    "In the role of Sao Paulo's city planners, we have been granted a certain amount of resources to solve the congestion problem of Sao Paulo. The issue at hand becomes that of choosing which roads to renovate. More formally, the goal is eventually to reduce the mean expected congestion time in traffic."
