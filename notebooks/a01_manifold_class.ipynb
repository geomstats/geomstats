    "In layman's terms, a $\\textbf{manifold}$ is a geometric object that looks exactly the same (has exactly the same properties) no matter what tiny little piece of it you focus on. When you are first learning, it can be helpful to think of a manifold as a surface. This surface can have any dimension and any shape as long as it is smooth (in the sense of being continuous and differentiable). For example, a hypersphere is a two dimensional manifold, and we will often use this manifold in examples. This is not a particularly precise definition, but it can be helpful starting point for building intuition. "
