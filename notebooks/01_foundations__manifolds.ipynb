    "1. There are three ways to define a manifold, and each of these three definitions provide a different option for manifold implementation.\n",
    "2. Learning to work with manifolds is useful because many datasets naturally lie on manifolds.\n",
    "3. The `Manifold` class stores information about many types of manifolds. Each of the subclasses implements a different $\\textit{type}$ of manifold (for example, `LevelSet`), and specific manifolds (for example, `Hypersphere`) are implemented within these subclasses."
