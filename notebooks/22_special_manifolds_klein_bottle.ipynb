    "The Klein bottle is a two-dimensional manifold named after German mathematician Felix Klein who first described it in 1882. Though it looks like a traditional bottle in three-dimensional Euclidian space, it can only be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ rather than $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, and cannot hold any volume due to it being one-sided. If someone were to walk along the surface of the bottle, their geodesic could trace back to the origin while flipping them upside down as it is both closed and non-orientable. Similar the torus or sphere, the Klein bottle has no \"inside\" and would result in two strips if cut open.\n",

    "Beginning with the fundamental polygon in the upper-left square, we can construct a Klein bottle by attaching the color-matched triangles, creating a cylindrical shape which will then intersect itself. The circle of self-intersection is referred to as an \"immersion\" of the Klein bottle in three dimensions.\n",

Unlike the complete Klein bottle, the Möbius strip can be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidian space $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. In similar fashion, connecting the ends of a \"spherinder\" yields a \"spherinder Klein bottle,\" which cannot be fully embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ but $\\mathbb{R}^{5}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given its unique shape, the Klein bottle has limited practical applications in real-world environments; however, it has been used to demonstrate some effects in physics such as the siphon effect when submerged in water. It has also been used in the field of solid-state physics as a topological representation of the \"Brillouin zone,\" $\\tau_{1/2}$, whose momentum space we see below. Under specific identifications of its boundaries, a Klein bottle is formed and topologically identifies the quotient space of the Brillouin zone, a fundamental concept in the study of the electronic and optical properties of materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brillouin zone describes the locus of points in reciprocal space that are closer to the origin of the reciprocal lattice than they are to any other reciprocal lattice points. This provides a way of modeling the behavior of electrons in a crystal lattice in terms of their wavevectors.\n",
