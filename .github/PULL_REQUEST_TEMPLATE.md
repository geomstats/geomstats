<!-- For checking consistency of entire codebase
First, run the tests related to your changes. For example, if you changed something in geomstats/spd_matrices_space.py:
$ pytest tests/tests_geomstats/test_spd_matrices.py

and then run the tests of the whole codebase to check that your feature is not breaking any of them:
$ pytest tests/

This way, further modifications on the code base are guaranteed to be consistent with the desired behavior. Merging your PR should not break any test in any backend (numpy, tensorflow or pytorch)."

For testing in alternative backends such as `numpy`, `pytorch`, `autograd`, `tensorflow` set the environment variable using:
$ export GEOMSTATS_BACKEND=<backend_name>

Next, import the `backend` module using:
import geomstats.backend as gs

<!-- For flake8 tests
Install dependencies
$ pip3 install -r dev-requirements.txt

Then run the following commands:
$ flake8 --ignore=D,W503,W504 geomstats examples tests   #shadows .flake8
$ flake8 geomstats/geometry geomstats/learning           #passed two subfolders
