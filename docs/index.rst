Geomstats
=========

*Geomstats provides code for computations and statistics on manifolds with geometric structures.*

The package is organized into two main modules:
`geometry` and `learning`.

The module `geometry` implements concepts in Riemannian geometry,
such as manifolds and Riemannian metrics, with an object-oriented approach.

The module `learning` implements statistics and learning algorithms for data
on manifolds. The code is object-oriented and classes inherit from
Scikit-Learn base classes and mixin.
