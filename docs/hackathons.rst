Hackathons
==========

Geomstats core developers organize several hackathons a year, with the following goals:
  * Train new users, e.g. pairing a new user with an experienced Geomstats developer.
  * On-board new contributors, e.g. on collaborative coding practices.
  * Foster new collaborations and strengthen existing ones
  * Bring the community of geometric statistics and learning together.


Interested? Feel free to:
  * Join the next hackathons, either remotely or in person (see section below)
  * Contact Geomstats core developers via Slack to ask about organizing a hackathon at your institution!
  * Organize a hackathon yourself!

Workflow
--------

Coding as a group in an open-source project is different from coding alone.

This is the typical collaborative workflow at a hackathon:

1. **Join** Geomstats slack workspace: Join channel associated with your hackathon 

2. **Assign** yourself to a GitHub task on the GitHub project associated with your hackathon 

3. **Code** a few lines on a new GitHub branch

4. **Document** your code with docstrings

5. **Test** with unit-tests

6. **Lint** to respect the coding style

7. **Submit** a PR on GitHub

8. **Address** code reviews

9. **Merge** your PR

10. **Repeat** :) 

More details can be found in the contributing guidelines.

In a one-day hackathon:
  * we start with a stand-up meeting, where each participant states their goal for the day,
  * participants go through steps 1-10, on a (possibly small) code additions.

In a one-week hackathon:
  * we organize daily stand-up meetings,
  * we expect participants to go 2-3 times through steps 1-10.
