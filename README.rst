**NEWS**:

- The white papers summarizing the findings from our ICLR 2021 and 2022 challenges of computational differential geometry and topology are available `here (2021) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09810>`__ and `here (2022) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09048>`_.

- Check out our new  `information_geometry <https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats/tree/master/geomstats/information_geometry>`_ module.

Geomstats is an open-source Python package for computations and
statistics on manifolds. The package is organized into two main modules:
``geometry`` and ``learning``.

The module ``geometry`` implements concepts in differential geometry,
and the module ``learning`` implements statistics and learning
algorithms for data on manifolds.

-  To get an overview of ``geomstats``, see our `introductory
   video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju-Wsd84uG0&list=PLYx7XA2nY5GejOB1lsvriFeMytD1-VS1B&index=3>`__.

We would sincerely appreciate citations to both the original research paper and the software version, to acknowledge authors who started the codebase and made the library possible, together with the crucial work of all contributors who are continuously implementing pivotal new geometries and important learning algorithms, as well as refactoring, testing and documenting the code to democratize geometric statistics and (deep) learning and foster reproducible research in this field.

Install geomstats via pip3
--------------------------

From a terminal (OS X & Linux), you can install geomstats and its
requirements with ``pip3`` as follows:

::

    pip3 install geomstats

This method installs the latest version of geomstats that is uploaded on
PyPi. Note that geomstats is only available with Python3.

Install geomstats via conda
--------------------------

From a terminal (OS X & Linux) or an Anaconda prompt (Windows), you can install geomstats and its
requirements with ``conda`` as follows:

::

    conda install -c conda-forge geomstats

This method installs the latest version of geomstats that is uploaded on
conda-forge. Note that geomstats is only available with Python3.

Install geomstats via Git
-------------------------

From a terminal (OS X & Linux), you can install geomstats and its
requirements via ``git`` as follows:

::

    git clone https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats.git
    cd geomstats
    pip3 install .

This method installs the latest GitHub version of geomstats.


To add the requirements into a conda environment, you can use the
``enviroment.yml`` file as follows:

::

   conda env create --file environment.yml

Note that this only installs the minimum requirements. To add the optional,
development, continuous integration and documentation requirements,
refer to the file ``setup.cfg``.

Install geomstats : Developers
------------------------------

Developers should git clone the master branch of this repository, together with the development requirements
and the optional requirements to enable ``pytorch`` backends:

::

    pip3 install geomstats[dev,opt]

Additionally, we recommend installing our pre-commit hook, to ensure that your code
follows our Python style guidelines:

::

    pre-commit install


Choose the backend
------------------

Geomstats can run seamlessly with ``numpy``, ``autograd`` or
``pytorch``. Note that ``autograd`` and ``pytorch`` and requirements are
optional, as geomstats can be used with ``numpy`` only. By default, the
``numpy`` backend is used. The visualizations are only available with
this backend.

To get the ``autograd`` and ``pytorch`` versions compatible with
geomstats, install the optional requirements:

::

    pip3 install geomstats[opt]

To install only the requirements for a given backend do:

::

    pip3 install geomstats[<backend_name>]

You can choose your backend by setting the environment variable
``GEOMSTATS_BACKEND`` to ``numpy``, ``autograd`` or ``pytorch``, and
importing the ``backend`` module. From the command line:

::

    export GEOMSTATS_BACKEND=<backend_name>

and in the Python3 code:

::

    import geomstats.backend as gs

Getting started
---------------

To use ``geomstats`` for learning algorithms on Riemannian manifolds,
you need to follow three steps: 

* instantiate the manifold of interest,
* instantiate the learning algorithm of interest, 
* run the algorithm.

The data should be represented by a ``gs.array``. This structure
represents numpy arrays, or pytorch tensors, depending on the
choice of backend.

The following code snippet shows the use of tangent Principal Component
Analysis on simulated ``data`` on the space of 3D rotations.

.. code:: python

    from geomstats.geometry.special_orthogonal import SpecialOrthogonal
    from geomstats.learning.pca import TangentPCA

    so3 = SpecialOrthogonal(n=3, point_type="vector")
    metric = so3.bi_invariant_metric

    data = so3.random_uniform(n_samples=10)

    tpca = TangentPCA(metric=metric, n_components=2)
    tpca = tpca.fit(data)
    tangent_projected_data = tpca.transform(data)

All geometric computations are performed behind the scenes. The user
only needs a high-level understanding of Riemannian geometry. Each
algorithm can be used with any of the manifolds and metric implemented
in the package.
